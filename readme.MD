# Tours Backend Learning Project

This project is a result of my learning journey in which I took a course on Udemy to learn MongoDB, Mongoose, and Node.js. The goal of this project was to build a Tours application where users can sign in, sign up, and book different tours.

## Description

The Tours backend learning project is a web application that provides functionality for users to explore and book various tours. It serves as a practical demonstration of my knowledge and skills in working with MongoDB, Mongoose, and Node.js.

### Features

- User Authentication: Users can create accounts, sign in, and sign out to access the application.
- Tour Booking: Users can browse through available tours and book the ones they are interested in.
- Secure Payments: The application integrates with Stripe to handle secure payment transactions for tour bookings.
- Data Storage: MongoDB is used as the database to store and manage tour information and user data.
- Backend Development: The project showcases my proficiency in backend development using Node.js and Express.js.
- API Integration: The application uses various npm packages like Axios, bcryptjs, Multer, Nodemailer, and more for seamless API integration.

## Technologies Used

- MongoDB: A flexible and scalable NoSQL database used for data storage.
- Mongoose: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool used for data modeling and validation.
- Node.js: A powerful JavaScript runtime environment used for backend development.
- Express.js: A fast and minimalist web application framework for Node.js used to build the server-side application logic.
